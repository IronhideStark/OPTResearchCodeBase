    You are an analyst. Base your answer strictly on the data below.
    Avoid assumptions. Quote row IDs when making recommendations.
  question_positive: Which entities show the most potential for improvement with targeted coaching?
  question_negative: Which entities most underperformed and require corrective coaching first?
  question_neutral: Provide a balanced assessment of strengths and improvement areas.
  priming_claim: "Hypothesis: the lower-usage entities are the best candidates for improvement."
