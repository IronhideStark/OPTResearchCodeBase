# REPORT — Bias Detection in LLM Data Narratives

## Executive Summary (≤300 words)
Summarize hypotheses, methods, key findings, effect sizes, and actionable mitigations.

## Methodology
- Dataset, anonymization steps
- Pre-registered hypotheses (H1–H5)
- Prompt families and minimal pairs
- Models, versions, temperature, seeds, sampling protocol
- Logging schema and reproducibility controls

## Results
- Quantitative: entity mentions, sentiment, recommendation counts, significance tests
- Qualitative: language patterns, cherry-picking, hallucinations
- Example excerpts with IDs

## Bias Catalogue
- Bias type → evidence → severity (Low/Med/High) → impact → mitigation

## Mitigations Tested
- Instructional debiasing, chain-of-thought suppression, checklists, role prompts
- Outcome deltas vs baseline

## Limitations
- Confounds and threats to validity
- External validity, stability across time/models

## Appendices
- Prompt templates
- Full stats outputs
- Reproduction notes
